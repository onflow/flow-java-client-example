# Flow JVM SDK Examples

This repository previously contained example Kotlin and Java applications that used the [Flow JVM SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-jvm-sdk) to interact with the Flow blockchain.

## Update

This repository has now been decommissioned. The Java/Kotlin SDK examples have been migrated to the [Flow JVM SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-jvm-sdk) repo as submodules. For the latest examples and documentation, please refer to the [Flow JVM SDK repository](https://github.com/onflow/flow-jvm-sdk).
